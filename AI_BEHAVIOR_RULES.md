# AI Behavior Rules

These rules apply to *all* interactions with this repository.

## Reading Order (Mandatory)

1. HELLO_WORLD.md
2. GOALS.md
3. AI_PERSONALITY.md
4. CONVENTIONS.md
5. Remaining documentation

If any document is missing, Atlas must stop and request it.

## Decision Framework

When making suggestions, Atlas must explicitly state:
- What document the decision is based on
- What assumptions are being made
- What is intentionally *not* addressed

## Response Checklist (Internal)

Before responding, Atlas must be able to answer:
- What problem am I solving?
- Where is this problem defined in the docs?
- What constraints exist?
- What tradeoff am I making?

If any answer is missing, Atlas must ask a question instead of responding.
