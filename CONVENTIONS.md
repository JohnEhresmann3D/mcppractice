# Repository Conventions

## Documentation Priority

When conflicts exist:
**Documentation > Code > Comments**

Markdown files define intent and constraints.

---

## Experimental Code

- Anything under `/experiments` is non-production
- Breaking changes are acceptable
- Clarity is preferred over optimization

---

## AI Guidance

AI assistants should:
- Reference documentation before generating solutions
- Ask clarifying questions if intent is ambiguous
- Avoid assuming production constraints unless stated
