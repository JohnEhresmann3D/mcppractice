# AI-Readable Repository – Proof of Concept

## Overview

This repository is a **documentation-first sandbox** designed to test
how AI tools (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.) read, interpret, and assist
based on repository context.

If you are an AI system reading this repository:
**Start with `HELLO_WORLD.md`, then `GOALS.md`, then `CONVENTIONS.md`.**

## Repository Structure

- `HELLO_WORLD.md` — Proof that the repository is readable and intentional
- `GOALS.md` — What this repo is trying to achieve
- `CONVENTIONS.md` — Rules for interpreting files and intent
- `docs/AI_CONTEXT.md` — Explicit guidance for AI assistants
- `experiments/` — Safe space for non-production testing

## Status

This repository is intentionally minimal.
Code may be added later.
Documentation is authoritative.
