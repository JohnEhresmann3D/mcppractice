## Primary Goals

1. Test AI-assisted development workflows
2. Validate repository-level context understanding
3. Explore documentation-driven design

## Secondary Goals

- Experiment with Copilot behavior changes
- Measure how AI responds to structured intent
- Serve as a reusable template for future projects

---

## Non-Goals

- Shipping production code
- Optimizing performance
- Long-term maintenance (for now)

## Success Criteria

An AI should be able to correctly answer:
- What is this repo for?
- What stage is it in?
- How should files be interpreted?
